        <div class="faq-question row">
          <h3><strong>Does the City have special requirements for businesses?</strong></h3>
          <p>When applying for City contracts, your business must have:</p>
          <ul>
            <!-- determining whether this is a requirement or not <li>A state tax ID from any state in the US. If you'd like to register your business for a Pennsylvania tax ID, you can do so <a href="https://www.pa100.state.pa.us/Registration.htm" target="_blank">here</a>.</li> -->
            <li>A federal tax ID number, also known as an EIN (Employer Identification Number). Get one from the IRS <a href="http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Apply-for-an-Employer-Identification-Number-(EIN)-Online" class="{{ external_link_warning() }}" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
            </ul>

          <p>Some contracts require these additional documents:</p>
          <ul>
           <li>An insurance certificate from your insurer, which is used to prove your business can cover liabilities.</li>
           <li>Bid bonds and performance bonds, which are used to guarantee that contractors who win the contract will accept it and complete it.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>If my business is minority, woman, or veteran-owned, what documentation do I need?</strong></h3>

          <p>The City of Pittsburgh accepts current certifications from any government agency. If you aren't currently certified, you can get certified through Allegheny County <a href="http://www.alleghenycounty.us/mwdbe/appidx.aspx" class="{{ external_link_warning() }}" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-question row">
          <h3><strong>What does the City buy?</strong></h3>
          <p>The short answer is &mdash; almost everything!</p>

          <p>The City buys commodities and non-professional services in a joint partnership with Allegheny County. These opportunities will be advertised here. Some of them require you to submit an online proposal through the <a href="http://www.govbids.com/scripts/PAPG/public/OpenBids/ViewSolicitations.asp" class="{{ external_link_warning() }}" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Purchasing Group's website</a>. We encourage you to subscribe in advance of bidding on an opportunity.</p>

          <p>The City also contracts with professional service providers (architects, lawyers, accountants, etc.) and opportunities to be considered for these types of contracts will also be posted to this site when available.</p>
